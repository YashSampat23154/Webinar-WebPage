### Contribution

We accept all kinds of PRs, be it simple edits or corrections all you have to do is **fork** this repo. Please make sure you take care of the following before you submit a PR:

- **Turn on GitHub pages on your fork** and work in the master branch so that we can find any issues in the website on our own before we merge your PR.
- **Start a issue before you make a complex change** so that we can discuss what exactly are necessary changes and you don't lose focus while making them or the edit is deemed unnecessary by us, which will mean time wasted.
- **Name the PR properly**, if the PR has a related issue, mention it so that we can continue the discussion and check if your work solves the *issue*
